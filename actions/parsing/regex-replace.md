# Regex Replace

The Regex Replace action will help you replace in a given text (_Input_) all occurences of a string that matches a RegEx pattern (_Pattern_) with a different value (_Replace with_). The result of the action (the modified _Input_) will be stored in a token that has the name written in the _Store in Token_ field (_[output]_ in our example image)
