## Actions

File Management add-on have four big actions that can be used with various DNN Sharp products in numerous ways:

### **Get archive file names**: 
It does exactly what it says, returns the name of the files in a token. You can set-up this action using the following parameters:

 * **Description**: Something so you'd quickly know what this action is about;
 * **Error Message**: The admins will also see the detailed error message. Leave empty to use the default message;
 * **Condition**: This boolean expression is used to determine if this action will execute. Use it to enable or disable actions programatically. For example, you'd enable a ShowError action only if you've found an error let's say when you parsed a response from a web service. A common example is [HasRole:Administrators\|true] (which requires My Token to work) or [SomeField] == "Some Value". This field supports My Tokens. See More examples;
 * **Archive Upload Field**: Select one of the upload fields that you have in the form;
 * **Output token file names**: Specify the output token for file names.
