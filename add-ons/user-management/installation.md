# Installation

Install the add-on from *Host > Extensions* just as you would with any other extension.

In order to be able to use the actions included in the [User Management Add-on](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/integrations/user-management) you need at least one of the following base modules:
* [Action Form](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-form-builder)
* [Action Grid](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-grid-table-data)
* [API Endpoint](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/custom-dnn-api-endpoint)
* [Sharp Scheduler](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/sharp-task-scheduler)
