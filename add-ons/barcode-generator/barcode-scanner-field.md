## Barcode Scanner

The Barcode scanner field is a barcode reader for Code128, Code93, Code39, Standard/Industrial 2 of 5, Interleaved 2 of 5, Codabar and EAN-13 barcodes.

> Starting with [version 5.0.18](https://www.dnnsharp.com/download?p=BARCODE&v=05.00.18) it also supports scanning **QR codes**.

It supports one barcode in one image and detects what type of barcode there is.

This field allows you to scan barcodes using your device's camera. It's very easy to use - click on the Upload button, allow it to use your Camera device, just take a photo over the barcode and press OK. After just a few seconds, the Barcode Scanner finds a match and appends the corresponding code into the Action Form's input.

The scanning process has two operating modes:

* **Upload** - it scans the barcode from an image \(which you can take on the spot or select from your device's gallery\);
* **Scan** - it launches the camera and waits until it finds a valid barcode in the visual field. 

### Devices compatibilities:

  * any other Operating System out there with a mobile browser and/or a camera \(the camera is not mandatory as it also works with images from the gallery\)
