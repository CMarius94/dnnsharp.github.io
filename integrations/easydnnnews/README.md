# EasyDNNnews Add-on

This add-on works as a helper for those who want to Add, Edit or Publish articles that can be rendered/shown with the **Easy DNN News** module developed by EasyDNNSolutions.

When installed, the add-on comes with 4 predefined [Action Form](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-form-builder) templates that allow you to:
* Post Simple Article _(title, description)_
* Post Complete Article _(title, subtitle, categories, summary, desription, publish date and time, expire date, article image)_
* Post Event Article with Daily Recurrence
* Post Simple Event Article

but you are not limited to using only these templates.

You can also create your custom forms to make use of the [actions](easydnnnews-actions.html) that come with the add-on in order to achieve the desired functionality.
