On submit, the field generates a list of tokens which include data as following:
* all field data as JSON: _[\<fieldname\>]_
* all markers data as JSON: _[\<fieldname\>:markers]_
* map marker position as latitude and longitude: _[\<fieldname\>:lat]_, _[\<fieldname\>:long]_
* all circles data as JSON: _[\<fieldname\>:circles]_ (starting with version 5.0.656)

The field can also be used to display marker or multiple markers on a map based on values provided in the markers area of field's settings as seen below.
