# Date and Time

The Date and Time section provides three flexible datepicker widgets in the jQuery or Bootstrap style to easily handle date and time data.

You can customize the date picker using the jQuery Theme option from the General Settings section or by styling the CSS classes from the UI Settings section.

* [Date \(with jQuery DatePicker\)](/action-form/form-fields/form-fields-types/date-and-time/date-with-jquery-datepicker.html)
* [Date \(with Month/Year Picker\)](/action-form/form-fields/form-fields-types/date-and-time/date-with-monthyear-picker.html)
* [Date And Time](/action-form/form-fields/form-fields-types/date-and-time/date-and-time.html)
