# Dropdown with Autocomplete

Enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.

The Dropdown with Autocomplete field provides suggestions while you type into the field. For example type "dn" for Dnn Sharp.


### Options:

* Datasource 
  * Choose from existing data sources or provide values into the Item List area; Input one item per line. If you need to provide different text and value, then separate them by pipe. Can contain [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html).
* Initially Selected

  * The fields load initially having an initial value. Supports [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html) so you can pull data from various sources such as user profile.

* Number of items

  * The number of elements initially displayed after a search. On scroll, more elements matching the search term will be displayed \(default 50\). Supports [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html) so you can pull data from various sources such as user profile.

* Disable dropdown on click

  * It will only appear when you start typing.
