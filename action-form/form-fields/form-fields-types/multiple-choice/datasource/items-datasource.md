# Items Datasource

This is the datasource type that allows you to manually type the items that will show in the multiple choice field.

A valid datasource for the **Items datasource** type will look like:
  
| 1</br>2</br>3        | First\|1</br>Second\|2</br>Third\|3           |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| when you want to show _1_ to the user and the value behind it to be 1 as well     | when you want to show _First_ to the user and 1 to be the value behind _First_|
