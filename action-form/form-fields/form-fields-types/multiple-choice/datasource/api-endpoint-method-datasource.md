# API Endpoint Method Datasource

> The feature is available starting with modules released after 28<sup>th</sup> of June 2019 (Action Form 5.0.607)

This datasource type allows you to use a **_local_ [API Endpoint Method](/dnnapiendpoint/index.html)** as source of data for your multiple choice fields.

In functionality, it is extremely similar to the [**Server Request (JSON)** datasource](/action-form/form-fields/form-fields-types/multiple-choice/datasource/server-request-json-datasource.html) just that it eliminates the internet connection speed factor by calling the API method locally exactly how the [Execute API Method](/actions/data/execute-api-method.html) works.
